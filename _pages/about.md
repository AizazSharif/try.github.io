I am [Aizaz](https://www.simula.no/people/aizaz) Sharif, a Ph.D. researcher in the [VIAS](https://www.simula.no/research/research-departments/validation-intelligence-autonomous-software/) department at Simula Research Laboratory and the University of Oslo supervised by [Dusica Marijan](https://www.simula.no/people/dusica). My Ph.D. is focused on testing and validating A.I. based autonomous driving systems mainly using deep reinforcement learning in a multi-agent driving environment.
